# 3. Binary Tree Quiz

#### What are two different ways to implement a depth-first traversal?

1. Iterative: Using an **explicit stack** with an array and the pop/push methods
2. Recursive: Using the underlying call stack

#### In a binary tree, what term is used to describe the nodes that have no children?

Leaves

#### In a binary tree, what term is used to describe the single node that has no parent?

Root

#### What data structures are used to implement depth-first and breadth-first traversal?

- Depth-first: Stack
- Breadth-first: Queue

#### What does the word "binary" mean in "binary tree"?

Each node in a binary tree has at most two children -- right and left

#### What is the least number of nodes a binary tree may have?

Zero nodes. The empty tree is considered as a binary tree; this is useful thinking for recursive algorithms.
