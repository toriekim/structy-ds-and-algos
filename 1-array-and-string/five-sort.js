/**
 * Write a function, fiveSort, that takes in an array of numbers

 * original array. The function should return the array.
 *
 * Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the
 * output, as long as all 5s are at the end of the array.
 *
 * EX) fiveSort([12, 5, 1, 5, 12, 7]);
 *     // -> [12, 7, 1, 12, 5, 5]
